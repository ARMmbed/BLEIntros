#mbed and BLE in Depth

This section covers some BLE and mbed concepts in greater detailed than our Getting Started section:

1. [Event Driven Programming](/InDepth/Events/): the event-driven nature of mbed programming and specifically its use in BLE.

2. [Debugging BLE on mbed](/InDepth/Debugging/): some techniques for debugging BLE.

3. [Rapid prototyping on mbed BLE](/InDepth/Prototyping.md/): how to rapidly prototype your product's app side.

2. [Modes and Profiles](/InDepth/BLEInDepth/): some BLE concepts such as GATT, GAP, advertising and connected modes and profiles.

3. [Connection Parameters](/InDepth/ConnectionParameters/): parameters that affect BLE's operation and specifically power use.

4. [BLE Limitations](/InDepth/Limitations/): current limitations of the BLE technology.
