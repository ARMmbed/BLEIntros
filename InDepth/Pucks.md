[Pucks](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/) are a BLE-enabled mbed platform created by Nordic Semiconductor. They use your [smart phone](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/smartphone-apps.html) to get you into the internet of things. All pucks use the Puck.h file, which handles the BLE aspect of the puck; you can then write your own program to take advantage of the device's BLE capacity.

Puck [tutorials](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials.html) are available on the [Nordic GitHub page](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/), and samples are available on mbed:

1. The **location** puck [sample](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/Nordic-Pucks/code/location-puck/) and [tutorial](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/location.html). This is the basic puck, used as a starting point by all other puck types.

2. The **IR** puck [sample](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/Nordic-Pucks/code/ir-puck/) and [tutorial](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/ir.html).

3. The **cube puck** [sample](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/Nordic-Pucks/code/cube-puck/) and [tutorial](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/cube.html).

4. The **display puck** [sample](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/Nordic-Pucks/code/display-puck/) and [tutorial](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/display.html).

And don't forget to read about the [phone app Puck Central](http://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/puck/tutorials/smartphone-apps.html), which is required to use the pucks. The app is available for both [Android](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/puck-central-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/puck-central-ios).
