#Firmware Over the Air

Firmware Over the Air (FOTA) is our latest development for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices. We're working towards enabling FOTA for the platforms based on Nordic's [nRF51822](http://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51822/) Bluetooth system, so that any BLE application may enable FOTA by the simple addition of a Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) service to its GATT server.

You can view a [short video about FOTA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54V2_4TR9Wo#t=114), starting at 01:55. We'll show you the same example, in greater detail, below. 

Note that this functionality requires the use of a (Nordic-specific) DFU boot loader on the device, to provide the basic functionality of firmware download and reprogramming. Instructions for the boot loader’s installation are available below.

**Warning:** at the moment, the firmware-update protocol has very little security; we're working on this.

We’ll start with a general review of the software components needed to support FOTA, and then move to an execution example to show just how easily a FOTA update can be performed.

##Software Components

The following figure shows the layout of the main software components of a FOTA-capable system. These include:

1.	**SoftDevice:** Nordic's encapsulation of the Bluetooth stack.

2.	**Application:** the user's BLE application.

3.	**Boot loader:** responsible for firmware updates.

###How FOTA Updates Work

FOTA updates rely on the SoftDevice and boot loader:

1.	On power up, the SoftDevice checks the User Information Configuration Register (UICR). The UICR can point either to the app or to the boot loader. 
	* If the UICR points to the app, the SoftDevice passes control to the app, which starts up normally.
	
	* If the UICR points to the boot loader, the SoftDevice passes control to the boot loader. The UICR will point to the boot loader if the boot loader had overwritten it; see our Default Boot Loader to understand how that's done. For a FOTA platform, a bootloader is always resident, with the UICR pointing to it.

2.	The boot loader determines if either control needs to be forwarded to the application or if it should remain waiting for a new application firmware image to be sent over the DFU service. The former case being the default. 

FOTA is reliable, but the application might block it by hanging in interrupt context (preventing the BLE stack from receiving an update, which prevents FOTA’s forwarding control to the boot loader). In this case, you’ll have to restart the device to enable further updates.  

The FOTA process can currently be driven from an external BLE agent, such as an Android phone. For the moment, we recommend using [Nordic's nRF Master Control Panel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.nordicsemi.android.mcp) as a generic tool. You can see more information about it below.

We'll soon be releasing our own reference apps for iOS and Android, together with SDKs to build custom apps for FOTA.

###The Default Boot Loader

The boot loader must be preinstalled on the device. To install a fully-functional default boot loader, please download [this image](https://developer.mbed.org/media/uploads/rgrover1/ble_default_bootloader_app.hex). Remember that it is designed for the Nordic nRF51822 mKIT. 

The image also contains a default application, which serves as an example of FOTA implementation. See below for more information. 

###Update Packages

mbed platforms typically come with an interface chip called [CMSIS-DAP](https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/CMSIS-DAP), which offers drag-n-drop programming (usually over USB). This mechanism erases everything on the chip before programming the new firmware, so binaries used with this method must include the SoftDevice and any other pre-requisites. FOTA application updates are different; they affect only the application, so the SoftDevice and boot loader aren't deleted, and therefore don't need to be included in the application update package. This reduces the size of the package, helping it meet BLE limitations. 

###Virtual Platforms

As we said, FOTA applications don't need to be combined with the SoftDevice as they do not erase the existing SoftDevice. They therefore need a separate (virtual) build target for each Nordic platform. These are generated by building for "shadow" platforms specifically intended for FOTA. You can get virtual platforms for [mKIT](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51822-FOTA/), [nRF-DK](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/Nordic-nRF51-DK-FOTA/) and others. You'll need to add these to your online compiler and build for them when generating FOTA binaries.

###Adding DFU Support to an Application

When you build for a FOTA-enabled platform, an instance of DFUService is implicitly added during the call to ble.init(). The assumption is that any application built for a FOTA-enabled platform wants to enable FOTA.

If you're building for a non-FOTA platform, you'll need to explicitly introduce DFUService support into an application; this requires only two lines of code:

1. Include the ``DFUService.h`` header.

2. Call the service, as shown below:

```c

	/* Enable over-the-air firmware updates. 
	*Instantiating DFUSservice introduces a
	* control characteristic which can be used to 
	* trigger the application to
	* handover control to a resident bootloader. */

	DFUService dfu(ble);
```

##Running a FOTA Update

The next three sections explain how to use Nordic's Master Control Panel to view, trigger and drive a FOTA update. As an example, we’ll update the default app bundled into the initial boot loader image. Among other services, this application offers a DFU service that supports FOTA.

You can view a [short video demonstrating this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54V2_4TR9Wo#t=114), starting at 01:55.
