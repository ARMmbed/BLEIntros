# Section overview

As we explained in the [guide overview](../index.md), mbed currently supports both mbed Classic and mbed OS. Most of this guide covers mbed Classic, so we created this section to highlight the differences between BLE on mbed Classic and BLE on mbed OS:

* [Creating mbed OS BLE applications](mbed_OS_BLE_Apps.md): guidelines for creating BLE applications that run on mbed OS.

* [Review of mbed OS BLE examples](mbed_OS_examples.md): how to build and run the mbed OS versions of the BLE examples.
