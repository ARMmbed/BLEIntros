# Section overview

As we explained in the [guide overview](../index.md), mbed currently supports all versions of mbed OS. Most of this guide covers mbed OS 2.0 and 5.0, so we created this section to highlight the differences between BLE on mbed OS 2.0 and 5.0 and BLE on mbed OS 3.0:

* [Creating mbed OS 3.0 BLE applications](mbed_OS_BLE_Apps.md): guidelines for creating BLE applications that run on mbed OS 3.0.

* [Review of mbed OS 3.0 BLE examples](mbed_OS_examples.md): how to build and run the mbed OS 3.0 versions of the BLE examples.
