# mbed BLE

Welcome. We're here to help you build something awesome with an mbed-enabled BLE platform.

If you're totally new check out our [starters documentation](Introduction/BeginnersIntro.md), which will walk you through everything you need to know. If you have some BLE experience, check out the [short version](Introduction/DevIntro.md) and get your first project up and running. 

This guide covers: 

1. [Introduction to BLE](Introduction/Overview.md): Explores BLE as a technology and as a protocol. While this section might occasionally refer to one version or another of mbed OS, it is largely valid for all versions.

1. [Advanced samples and features](Advanced/Overview.md): Reviews more advanced BLE features.

1. [Additional resources](Additional/Overview.md): Provides links to other sources, answers to frequently asked questions and a list of abbreviations.
