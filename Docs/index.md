#mbed BLE

Welcome. We're here to help you build something awesome with an mbed-enabled BLE platform.

If you're totally new check out our [starters documentation](../Docs/GettingStarted/BeginnersIntro.md), which will walk you through everything you need to know. If you have some BLE experience, check out the [short version](../Docs/GettingStarted/DevIntro.md) and get your first project up and running. 

Some other references are our:

* Our [review](../Docs/InDepth/BLEInDepth.md) of BLE concepts.
* [Tutorials](../GettingStarted/IntroSamples.md), which cover basic BLE and programming concepts.
* [Code samples](../Docs/AdvSamples/Overview.md), which cover service creation and advanced features.
* If you're overwhelmed by abbreviations, try our [abbreviation list](../Docs/Additional/Abbr.md).

If after reading through our documents you find that you still have questions, try our [FAQ](../Docs/Additional/BLE_FAQ.md) or ask [the community](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/community/).
