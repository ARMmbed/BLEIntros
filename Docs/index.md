#mbed BLE

Welcome. We're here to help you build something awesome with an mbed-enabled BLE platform.

<span class="notes">**Note:** This version of the documentation covers mbed OS 2.0 and 5.0. If you're working with mbed OS 3.0, please [go here](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/ble-intros/en/latest/).</span>

If you're totally new check out our [starters documentation](GettingStarted/BeginnersIntro.md), which will walk you through everything you need to know. If you have some BLE experience, check out the [short version](GettingStarted/DevIntro.md) and get your first project up and running. 

Some other references are our:

* [Review](InDepth/BLEInDepth.md) of BLE concepts.
* [Tutorials](GettingStarted/IntroSamples.md), which cover basic BLE and programming concepts.
* [Code samples](AdvSamples/Overview.md), which cover service creation and advanced features.
* If you're overwhelmed by abbreviations, try our [abbreviation list](Additional/Abbr.md).

If after reading through our documents you find that you still have questions, try our [FAQ](Additional/BLE_FAQ.md) or ask [the community](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/community/).
