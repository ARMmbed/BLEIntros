#mbed and BLE in Depth

This section covers some BLE and mbed concepts in greater detailed than our Getting Started section:

1. [Event Driven Programming](../mbed_Classic/Events.md): the event-driven nature of mbed programming and specifically its use in BLE.

2. [Debugging BLE on mbed](../Advanced/Debugging.md): some techniques for debugging BLE.

3. [Rapid prototyping on mbed BLE](../Advanced/Prototyping.md): how to rapidly prototype your product's app side.

2. [Modes and Profiles](../Introduction/BLEInDepth.md): some BLE concepts such as GATT, GAP, advertising and connected modes and profiles.

3. [Connection Parameters](../Introduction/ConnectionParameters.md): parameters that affect BLE's operation and specifically power use.

4. [BLE Limitations](../Advanced/Limitations.md): current limitations of the BLE technology.
