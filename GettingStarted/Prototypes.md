#Prototypes and Getting Information From Users

Prototyping is a lot easier (and faster) if you don't have to build an app for user interaction. Not only are apps lots of work, they also aren't compatible with different operating systems (iOS and Android), or even with different versions of the same operating system.

So if you're in the prototyping phase, there are three easier ways to allow user interaction:

1. Hardware inputs directly to the BLE device, for example a [touchscreen](http://developer.mbed.org/components/cat/touchscreen/).

2. Websites that provide a standard user interface and send commands back to the device. They require programming, but they usually work well on all phones.

3. [Evothings Studio](http://evothings.com/getting-started-with-evothings-studio-in-90-seconds/) lets you create simple apps that are run from the Evothings App on your phone, so Evothings does the compatibility work for you. It requires some learning of its own, but it may well be worth your time.

Once your prototype is approved, you can invest some more time in your user input. At this point, apps may become worthwhile. But, if you want to be part of the Physical Web, stick to a website - and use the BLE device just to advertise the site's URL.
