#Tutorials Overview

Our tutorials are here to help you learn how to use BLE on mbed boards, and with the mbed Compiler. All tutorials include a quick-guide for experienced developers and more detailed explanations for new developers. A few of the first tutorials include some C++ background. 

The tutorials are numbered; you can work through them in any order you want, but if you're new to C++, you should probably go by the order we've suggested.

For all of these, you should have:

1. A BLE-enabled mbed board, but don't worry if you don't have one yet - we'll show you how it would have worked.

2. A user account on [developer.mbed.org](developer.mbed.org) to see the compiler. We recommend you get access to the compiler even if you don't have a board yet, so that you can play along with the example.

Some tutorials will have additional requirements, such as phone apps or additional hardware. These will be listed before you start working, so that you can have everything ready.

##Videos

We have a YouTube channel with videos that you might find useful:

1. mbed [quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5TcmFFD0iw): for a first-time user with a new board.  

2. [URI Beacon example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZ-_fZlV2-w): how to create a BLE URIBeacon using the mbed platform. We will import the project, modify the URIBeacon, compile, load code to the board, and demonstrate how to scan for the beacon with the Physical Web app.

3. [BLE GAP example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9uIx-NFS08): how to use the GAP advertising packet to transmit data with a BLE capable mbed platform. First without a name, then adding a name service to the device.

4. [Firmware updates](https://youtu.be/SSRCJgzeEek?list=PLiVCejcvpsetJ1n9nRXzLWvE4dp4RwGOf): how to update the firmware on an mbed platform..
