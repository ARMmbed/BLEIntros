#Advanced Samples Overview

Our advanced samples are designed to help you get serious projects into the prototyping stage.

##Service Templates

We've created two service templates that you can easily adapt to your needs:

1. The *input service* template demonstrates the use of a simple input (boolean values) from a read-only characteristic. You can get the code [here](http://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/code/BLE_Button/) or read the full explanation [here](https://developer.mbed.org/forum/team-63-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-community/topic/5500/).

2. The *actuator service* template demonstrates the use of a read-write characteristic to control an LED through a phone app. Â You can get the code [here](https://developer.mbed.org/teams/Bluetooth-Low-Energy/code/BLE_LED/) or read the full explanation [here](https://developer.mbed.org/forum/team-63-Bluetooth-Low-Energy-community/topic/5502/).
