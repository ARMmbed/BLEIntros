#mbed BLE

Welcome to the mbed BLE documentation. 

If you're an **experienced BLE developer**, you can start at the [short story](/GettingStarted/DevIntro/), and then check out some other things that might interest you, such as our [service creation samples](/AdvSamples/Overview/) or some of our [technical documents](/InDepth/BLEInDepth/).

If you're **new to all this**, you may be interested in our [extended documentation](/GettingStarted/DesignersIntro/), which includes [coding samples](/GettingStarted/IntroSamples/) with an introduction to C++ and the mbed compiler. These sections were written for designers who want to use BLE in their projects, and so assume no prior knowledge.
