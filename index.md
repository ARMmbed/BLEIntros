#mbed BLE

Welcome to the mbed BLE documentation.

There are two paths through our documentation. If you're an **experienced BLE developer**, you can skip to the [short story](/GettingStarted/DevIntro/), and then check out some other things that might interest you, such as our [service creation samples](/AdvSamples/Overview/). If you're **new to all this**, you might instead be interested in our [extended documentation](/GettingStarted/DesignersIntro/), which includes [coding samples](/GettingStarted/IntroSamples/) with an introduction to C++ and the mbed compiler.
