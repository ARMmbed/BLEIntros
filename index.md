#mbed BLE

Welcome. We're here to help you build something awesome with an mbed-enabled BLE platform.

If you're totally new check out our [starters documentation](/GettingStarted/DesignersIntro/), which will walk you through everything you need to know. If you have some BLE experience, check out the [short version](/GettingStarted/DevIntro/) and get your first project up and running. 

Some other references are our:

* [Tutorials](/GettingStarted/IntroSamples/), which cover basic BLE and programming concepts.
* [Code samples](/AdvSamples/Overview/), which cover service creation.
* Our [in depth review](/InDepth/BLEInDepth/) of BLE concepts.
