#mbed BLE

Welcome to mbed BLE. 

There are two paths through our documentation. If you're an **experienced BLE developer**, you can skip to the [shorty story](/GettingStarted/DevIntro/), and then check out some other things that might interest you, such as our [service creation samples](/AdvSamples/Overview/). If you're **new to all this**, you might instead be interested in our [extended documentation](/GettingStarted/DesignersIntro/).
